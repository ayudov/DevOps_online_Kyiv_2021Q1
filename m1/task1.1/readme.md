## **First lab in EPAM**
In this very first lab I've created my own test project using _Version Control System - Git_.

I've used basic commands of Git such as _commit_, _branch_, _checkout_, _log_, _push_ to handle different versions of the project.

I've solved one _merge conflict_ between two branches.

At the end I've pushed all local project to the GitHub.

## **What is DevOps?**
As I can judge so far, DevOps professionals are responsible for a whole lifetime of the project.
They have to conduct the product from the very beginning and even after production.

For DevOps, it is necessary to know how to use tools which will help him to handle it.

###### It consists of main stages:

Delivery pipeline: **BUILD, TEST, RELEASE**

Feedback Loop: **PLAN, MONITOR**

What  Wikipedia says:

_DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) 
and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life
cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.[1][2]
DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the Agile methodology._
