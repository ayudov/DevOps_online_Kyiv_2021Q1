## **First lab in EPAM**
In this very first lab I've created my own test project using _Version Control System - Git_.

I've used basic commands of Git such as _commit_, _branch_, _checkout_, _log_, _push_ to handle different versions of the project.

I've solved one _merge conflict_ between two branches.

At the end I've pushed all local project to the GitHub.

## **What is DevOps?**
As I can judge so far, DevOps professionals are responsible for a whole lifetime of the project.
They have to conduct the product from the very beginning and even after production.

###### It consists of main stages:

Delivery pipeline: **BUILD, TEST, RELEASE**

Feedback Loop: **PLAN, MONITOR**
